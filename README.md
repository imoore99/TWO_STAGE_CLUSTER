## Customer Segmentation for Auto Loan Prepayment Optimization

#### Two-Stage Cluster Analysis of Early Payoff Behavior

##### PROJECT OVERVIEW:

- Purpose: Identify high-risk customer segments driving accelerated auto loan prepayments during elevated rate environment to enable targeted retention strategies and portfolio yield optimization.
- Objective: Apply two-stage K-means clustering with categorical cross-tabulation to segment 30,000+ auto loans by prepayment behavior, identifying customer profiles with elevated early payoff risk (>3x baseline) for targeted intervention.

##### BUSINESS PROBLEM:

Auto loan portfolios experienced declining balances despite consistent application volumes during the Federal Reserve rate hiking cycle. Early payoff patterns compressed loan lifecycles, reducing portfolio yield and profitability. Management required comprehensive analysis to identify key drivers behind prepayment acceleration and prioritize customer segments for retention strategies and lifecycle management optimization.

##### DATA SOURCES:

- Primary: Auto loan origination and performance data (2020-2025)
- Features: LTV, credit score, loan amount, origination date, product type (Direct/Indirect), collateral condition (New/Used)
- Sample Size: 30,000+ loans across multiple origination cohorts
- Validation: Cohort analysis and comparative performance metrics across rate environments

##### KEY FINDINGS & RESULTS:

- Rate Impact: Confirmed Federal Reserve rate hiking cycle accelerated early payoffs by 185%, with one-month prepayments showing 2.76x increase representing the highest-impact intervention point
- Segmentation: Two-stage clustering methodology produced 10 quantitative customer segments, expanding to 40 product-specific segments through categorical overlays (Direct/Indirect √ó New/Used)
- Priority Targets: Identified five critical segments with early payoff rates 1.9x-2.8x baseline (Cluster 9 Indirect New at 6.54% leading segment)
- Business Impact: Generated detailed customer profiles and targeted retention recommendations for portfolio yield optimization and lifecycle management
